## Usage

This project provides an overview of servers for displaying specified information.
It includes a user login that can be accessed with the EMEA1/EMEA2 data. After the login you get access the user interface,
where you finally get a view of the servers and with a click on the server you get a detailed view of the server information.
It's also possible to manually change the status of the respective servers via the interface.
